# Psychic-Game

Basic psychic game in the browser, mainly coded in js wrapped in some bootstrap.

## How does it work?

Just type in letters as your guesses, and if you get it right, you'll get a nice "You're Winner!" on your screen! And if you lose or win, just keep typing in and it will automatically restart for you.

The game also keeps track of your wins and losses so try to win as much as you can!

## Sounds fun, how do I play?

[Just click here!](https://zaneneuschuler.github.io/Psychic-Game/) It's already hosted on github pages so you don't even have to host it yourself. Have fun!
